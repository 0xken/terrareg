# Contributing

Please read the below before contributing any changes to the project.

## Upstream

The main upstream of this project is https://gitlab.dockstudios.co.uk/pub/terrareg.

Any changes submitted to any other instance (e.g. Github, Gitlab Cloud etc.) will be manually applied to the upstream and will then replicate downstream to other locations.

If you'd prefer, feel free to register an account to the main upstream - though registrations require approval, so just ping me an email :)

Any issues raised in any hosting platform, other than the 'main upstream' will be manually replicated to the 'main upstream'.

As a result, issue references in commit messages will only align with those in the 'main upstream'.

## Future license changes

The project is currently licensed under the AGPL license (see LICENSE file in root of repository).

If the requirement comes up, the maintainers withold the right to change the license of the project, and all code within it, to a more 'relaxed' license (e.g. GNU GPLv3, LGPL, MIT License, Apache License 2.0).

Any code submitted to this project must adhere to the current license and any of the licenses suggested above.

All contributers who submit changes must agree to submitting the work under the current license and that the license that the work is distributed under may change at any time (as suggested above) without any notification or consent (written or otherwise).

This does not allow for the relicense of any constributed code to a more restrive license (unless those, as suggested above, are deemed more restrictive).
